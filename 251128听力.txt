"dialogue": [
{
"speaker": "M",
"content": "Sarah, I need to bite the bullet and finalize this corporate assignment. The firm wants a retreat, but the policy on expenses is stricter than ever. I’m worried the budget won’t cover the entry fee for a decent venue."
},
{
"speaker": "W",
"content": "Don't let the numbers frighten you, Mark. You are capable of handling this. What category of activity are you considering? Skiing in that rural county up north?"
},
{
"speaker": "M",
"content": "I thought about it, but safety is a major component. I don't want a victim needing surgery because they broke a leg. That would turn into a massive legal affair. Plus, getting everyone to pack a heavy sweater and boots is a bother."
},
{
"speaker": "W",
"content": "True. Maybe something more informal? How about a costume party or a private theater session? It sounds fantastic and less risky."
},
{
"speaker": "M",
"content": "That could work. But food is another issue. I don't want to buy grocery items, stuff a refrigerator with cream, or worry about a complex recipe for every dish. I’m not a chef!"
},
{
"speaker": "W",
"content": "We can hire a catering service. Just ensure the contract says the price won't cost a bomb and includes the commission. We need proof of every payment for the mail audit."
},
{
"speaker": "M",
"content": "Good point. I’ll assume the role of instructor for the workshops. We need to keep upper management engaged without causing offense. I'll make a rule: no talk about the recent election, religion, or radio news."
},
{
"speaker": "W",
"content": "Smart. Just keep it light. Is your hobby still photography? You should capture the moments."
},
{
"speaker": "M",
"content": "Yes. I just hope my stomach holds up; the stress is real. I’ll say a prayer that I can just kick back and relax once we sweep through the agenda. Every phrase in the contract needs to be covered."
