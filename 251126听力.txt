## [Crisis Management]
**(Context: Two campaign strategists, Mark and Sarah, are discussing a serious incident involving their candidate running for Mayor just weeks before the election.)**

**Dialogue Script:**

**(W):** Mark, we have a disaster **downstairs**. The **domestic** staff is threatening to go on **strike**. Our **candidate**, Mr. Henderson, just had a meltdown.

**(M):** Again? I saw **trash** and broken **furniture** in the hallway. Did he really **drag** the heavy oak table across the room?

**(W):** Yes. He claimed the **chef** put a "political **trick**" in his soup. He threw a wet **towel**, and even his **underwear**, at the poor **servant**. It was incredibly **offensive**. He shouted that he is the **lord** of this manor, not a **plain** citizen.

**(M):** That violates every **criterion** of **civil** behavior. If this **external** news reaches the **Congress** or the ethics **panel**, our **capital** in this **contest** will vanish. We can’t **pretend** this is normal.

**(W):** I tried to **whisper** a warning to him, but he wouldn't **lean** in to listen. He has this **notion** that he can do whatever he wants. Honestly, he looks **hollow**. He’s smoking pack after pack of **cigarette**s; I’m worried about his **lung** capacity and **organ** failure.

**(M):** We need **insight** into his mental state. Is he fit for the **obligation** of being **mayor**? Regardless, we must **retain** control. What is the **amount** needed to settle this?

**(W):** The **attorney** sent a **quotation**. The staff demands a higher **wage** and a **sincere** apology, or they walk. It is a hefty sum.

**(M):** We have to **grant** it. Our **objective** is to win. We can’t let the **motor** of this campaign stall now. Is there any **stuff** we can use to spin this?

**(W):** Not really. He didn't act like a benevolent **priest**; he acted like a tyrant. Even the **quotation** from his speech regarding "family values" sounds **somewhat** ironic now.

**(M):** Fine. Pay them. I’ll go handle the candidate.

**Answer Key & Explanation:**

**1. C) The candidate’s inappropriate behavior and the resulting staff crisis.**
*   **Reason:** The dialogue revolves around the candidate ("Mr. Henderson") having a "meltdown," throwing "furniture" and "underwear," and the staff threatening to "strike." While health and finance are mentioned, they are secondary to the behavioral crisis.

**2. D) He became aggressive and threw personal items.**
*   **Reason:** The woman states, "He threw a wet towel, and even his underwear, at the poor servant." This matches the option of becoming aggressive and throwing personal items.

**3. B) Preventing the incident from becoming public to protect the campaign.**
*   **Reason:** The man mentions that if "external news reaches the Congress... our capital in this contest will vanish." He later states their "objective is to win" and agrees to pay to "retain control," implying the priority is containing the damage to the campaign.

**4. B) They will meet the financial and emotional demands of the staff.**
*   **Reason:** The woman mentions the staff demands a "higher wage" and a "sincere apology." The man concludes by saying, "We have to grant it... Pay them." This confirms they agree to meet the demands.
